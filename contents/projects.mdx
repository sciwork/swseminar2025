## **Modmesh** 

- **Languages:** Python, C++  
- **Focus Area:** PDE Solving and Visualization  
- **Contact:**
  - Yung-Yu Chen (Discord: @yyc#7718)
  - Chun-Hsu Lai (Discord: @Chun-Hsu#6296)
- **Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/solvcon/modmesh)  

**Description:**

Modmesh seamlessly integrates C++ and Python using pybind11, leveraging the strengths of both languages for efficient PDE solving. It features Qt and Python-based visualization for computational results, offering enhanced understanding of PDE solutions. Modmesh supports mesh visualization in the Gmsh format and is compatible across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Recent updates include improved UI/UX for better user experience.

## **Python Official Documents Translation (zh_TW)**
- **Languages:** Python, Translation  
- **Focus Area:** Localization of Python Documentation  
- **Contact:**
  - Matt Wang (Discord: matt.wang#3443)
  - Josix Wang (Discord: josix#3800)
- **Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw)  

**Description:**  

LLMs are highly skilled in translation. In the translation project workflow, which includes translation, terminology selection and definition, proofreading, and more, there are additional considerations such as formatting of the translated text, consistency in terminology usage, localization of terms, and the fluency of the translation.

We should consider what role LLMs should play in these processes, which tasks are best suited for LLMs to handle, and how adjustments to interactions with LLMs can enhance outcomes. Since this is still in the design phase, we welcome everyone to join the discussion!

<a name="sciwork-portal"></a>
## **sciwork Portal**
- **Technologies:** React, TailwindCSS, Netlify  
- **Focus Area:** Website Development and Maintenance  
- **Contacts:**  
  - Chester (Discord: @chester)  
  - Wuxian (Discord: @5x9527)  
- **Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/sciwork/swportal)  

**Description:**  

sciwork Portal maintains the official website, **sciwork.dev**, and related event pages, including **conf.sciwork.dev**. Built with Next.js and TailwindCSS, it offers promotional pages for meetups and sprint events. Our team is dedicated to enhancing user experience through better information presentation and visuals.

<a name="utensor"></a>
## **utensor**
- **Technologies:** C++11, TensorFlow 
- **Focus Area:** Machine learning inference
- **Contacts:**
    - Dboy (Discord: @dboyliao#1295)
- **Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/uTensor/uTensor)

**Description:**

uTensor is an extremely lightweight machine learning inference framework built on C++11. It simplifies model deployment by seamlessly converting TensorFlow-trained models into efficient C++ files that can be used for inference on embedded devices and integrate with optimized libraries such as CMSIS-NN by ARM with ease. Compared with binary files, C++ source code provides greater flexibility for embedding engineers to modify trained models. We provide defaults for tensors, operators, and memory allocation. Just like the booming development of machine learning, we are actively developing these functions. Welcome to join us.
