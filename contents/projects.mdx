## **Python Official Documents Translation (zh_TW)**
- **Languages:** Python, Translation  
- **Focus Area:** Localization of Python Documentation  
- **Contact:**
  - Matt Wang (Discord: matt.wang#3443)
  - Josix Wang (Discord: josix#3800)
- **Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw)  

**Description:**  

LLMs are highly skilled in translation. In the translation project workflow, which includes translation, terminology selection and definition, proofreading, and more, there are additional considerations such as formatting of the translated text, consistency in terminology usage, localization of terms, and the fluency of the translation.

We should consider what role LLMs should play in these processes, which tasks are best suited for LLMs to handle, and how adjustments to interactions with LLMs can enhance outcomes. Since this is still in the design phase, we welcome everyone to join the discussion!
