# science, code, and open source

## sciwork seminar 2025
Welcome to the sciwork Seminar 2025! Join us for an enriching day of
technical knowledge sharing and collaborative coding with experts and 
enthusiasts from the scientific computing community.


## Technical Talks
Our lineup of technical talks features cutting-edge topics presented by
industry experts:
- SIMD Vector acceleration techniques
- HPC Computational resource management
- K8s network management
- Autonomous driving technique
- DevOps & Security sharing

## Coding Sprint
Participate in our hands-on coding sprint sessions where you can collaborate 
with fellow developers on open-source scientific computing projects. Bring 
your laptop and dive straight into code with guidance from project 
maintainers.

## Why Attend?
- **Expert Knowledge:** Learn directly from specialists in scientific 
  computing and high-performance systems.
- **Hands-on Experience:** Apply concepts immediately during guided coding 
  sprints.
- **Community Connections:** Build relationships with fellow practitioners who 
  share your passion for computational science.
- **Open Source Contribution:** Make meaningful contributions to projects that 
  advance scientific computing.

## About sciwork
sciwork is a community of researchers and engineers to share and discuss 
computer code for scientific, numerical, and engineering work. We believe 
in the power of openness, and we will use open source as a means to advance 
software development for computational sciences.

Computational sciences are critically important as information technology has 
blended in every aspect of human activities. Proficiently speaking programming 
languages is a prerequisite for conducting most research and engineering work, 
and as practitioners observe, the simple task evolves into a hierarchy of 
skills that take years to acquire. To properly use computers for science or 
engineering, the problem is two-fold. We need a thorough understanding of the 
problem to solve, and simultaneously we need to master computer programming to 
deliver a reliable solution. It is overly challenging since either of both is 
already complicated.

sciwork would like to get involved in the global effort to solve the issue of 
code development entangling with science and engineering. There will be 
sprints, hands-on tutorials, and technical talks in the conference. Attendees 
are expected to be in different levels of code development. We will work 
together for good and open computational sciences.
